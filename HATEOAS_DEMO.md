# HATEOAS Implementation Demo

## ✅ Status: FIXED AND WORKING!

The compilation issue has been resolved by adding proper Maven compiler plugin configuration with Lombok annotation processing support.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added Maven Compiler Plugin Configuration** in `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
       <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
       <version>3.13.0</version>
       <configuration>
           <source>17</source>
           <target>17</target>
           <annotationProcessorPaths>
               <path>
                   <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
                   <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
                   <version>1.18.30</version>
               </path>
           </annotationProcessorPaths>
       </configuration>
   </plugin>
   ```

2. **Lombok is now generating getters/setters correctly**
3. **All HATEOAS assemblers are working**
4. **Application compiles and runs successfully**
5. **Tests are passing**

## HATEOAS Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features:

1. **5 Model Assemblers Created**:
   - ProductoModelAssembler
   - ClienteModelAssembler
   - PedidoModelAssembler
   - ReservaModelAssembler
   - CategoriaModelAssembler

2. **All Controllers Updated** to return HATEOAS responses using EntityModel/CollectionModel

3. **Dynamic Navigation Links**:
   - **Products ↔ Categories**: Products link to categories, categories to products
   - **Clients ↔ Orders**: Clients link to their orders, orders link back to clients
   - **Orders ↔ Products**: Orders link to individual products and collections
   - **Reservations ↔ Clients/Products**: Full bidirectional navigation
   - **Self-referential links**: All resources have self links
   - **Collection links**: Individual resources link to their collections

4. **Action Links**:
   - CRUD operations (update, delete) for all resources
   - State-based actions for reservations (confirm/cancel when pending)

## How to Test the HATEOAS Implementation

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Example HATEOAS Response Structure
When you make a request to any endpoint (after authentication), you'll get responses like:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "nombre": "Cuaderno Universitario",
  "descripcion": "Cuaderno de 100 hojas",
  "precio": 5.99,
  "stock": 50,
  "categoria": {
    "id": 1,
    "nombre": "Papelería"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/productos/1"
    },
    "productos": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/productos"
    },
    "categoria": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/categorias/1"
    },
    "update": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/productos/1"
    },
    "delete": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/productos/1"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Run Tests to Verify
```bash
# Run individual controller tests
mvn test -Dtest=ProductoControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=ClienteControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=PedidoControllerTest

# Run all tests except integration test
mvn test
```

## Key HATEOAS Features Implemented

1. **EntityModel/CollectionModel Usage**: As requested, using Spring HATEOAS standard models
2. **Dynamic Link Generation**: Links are generated based on resource state and relationships
3. **RESTful Navigation**: Clients can navigate between related resources using links
4. **Hypermedia-Driven**: API is fully discoverable through links
5. **State-Based Actions**: Different actions available based on resource state

## Architecture Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: Clients don't need to construct URLs
- **Discoverability**: API structure is self-documenting through links
- **Evolvability**: URL changes don't break clients
- **Navigation**: Easy traversal between related resources

## Next Steps

The HATEOAS implementation is complete and working. You can now:

1. **Test the API** with tools like Postman or curl (remember to authenticate first)
2. **Explore the links** in the responses to navigate between resources
3. **Add more complex business logic** that leverages the hypermedia structure
4. **Extend the assemblers** with additional conditional links based on business rules

The implementation follows REST maturity level 3 (Hypermedia Controls) and provides the dynamic navigation you requested between orders→products, clients→orders, and all other resource relationships.
